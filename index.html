    <h2>Fostering the Learning of Today for the Action of Tomorrow</h2>
    <h5>Our mission is to create an impact on student’s lives throughout the globe towards a desire for the pursuit of knowledge, which will be quantified through higher academic performance, cultural competency, and pursuit of higher education.</h5>
    <p>
      As population rises on the global scale, the number of young children without access to quality education increases. Our goal is to expose children in developing countries with access to multiple disciplines that could enhance their future careers, as we strive to learn more about each other's cultures and grow together. This program is not meant to teach a student rigidly, but develop them with new experiences that will benefit students on both sides of the initiative.
